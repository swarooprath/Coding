Here's a comprehensive list of classic dynamic programming problems along with a brief explanation of their states, state transitions, base cases, and the general approach (either memoization or tabulation) used to solve them:

### 1. Fibonacci Sequence
- **States**: \( F(n) \) is the nth Fibonacci number.
- **State Transition**: \( F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \)
- **Base Cases**: \( F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1 \)
- **Approach**: Tabulation or memoization.

### 2. Rod Cutting Problem
- **States**: \( dp[i] \) represents the maximum revenue from cutting a rod of length \( i \).
- **State Transition**: \( dp[i] = \max(p[j] + dp[i-j]) \) for all \( j \leq i \)
- **Base Cases**: \( dp[0] = 0 \)
- **Approach**: Tabulation.

### 3. Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
- **States**: \( dp[i][j] \) is the length of LCS of the first \( i \) characters of one string and the first \( j \) characters of another string.
- **State Transition**: If characters match, \( dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1 \); otherwise, \( dp[i][j] = \max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) \).
- **Base Cases**: \( dp[i][0] = 0, dp[0][j] = 0 \)
- **Approach**: Tabulation.

### 4. 0/1 Knapsack Problem
- **States**: \( dp[i][w] \) is the maximum value achievable using the first \( i \) items with a knapsack of weight \( w \).
- **State Transition**: \( dp[i][w] = \max(dp[i-1][w], dp[i-1][w-weights[i]] + values[i]) \) if \( w \geq weights[i] \)
- **Base Cases**: \( dp[0][w] = 0, dp[i][0] = 0 \)
- **Approach**: Tabulation.

### 5. Coin Change Problem
- **States**: \( dp[x] \) is the minimum number of coins needed to make up amount \( x \).
- **State Transition**: \( dp[x] = \min(dp[x], dp[x - coin] + 1) \) for each coin.
- **Base Cases**: \( dp[0] = 0 \)
- **Approach**: Tabulation.

### 6. Minimum Path Sum in a Grid
- **States**: \( dp[i][j] \) is the minimum path sum to reach cell \( (i, j) \) from the top-left corner.
- **State Transition**: \( dp[i][j] = \min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j] \)
- **Base Cases**: \( dp[0][0] = grid[0][0] \)
- **Approach**: Tabulation.

### 7. Edit Distance (Levenshtein distance)
- **States**: \( dp[i][j] \) is the minimum edit distance between the first \( i \) characters of one string and the first \( j \) characters of another string.
- **State Transition**: \( dp[i][j] = \min(dp[i-1][j] + 1, dp[i][j-1] + 1, dp[i-1][j-1] + cost) \)
- **Base Cases**: \( dp[i][0] = i, dp[0][j] = j \)
- **Approach**: Tabulation.

### 8. Longest Increasing Subsequence
- **States**: \( dp[i] \) represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index \( i \).
- **State Transition**: \( dp[i] = \max(1, dp[j] + 1) \) for all \( j < i \) where \( arr[j] < arr[i] \)
- **Base Cases**: \( dp[i] = 1 \) for all \( i \)
- **Approach**: Tabulation.

### 9. Matrix Chain Multiplication
- **States**: \( dp[i][j] \) is the minimum number of scalar multiplications needed to compute the matrix product of matrices from index \( i \) to \( j \).
- **State Transition**: \( dp[i][j] = \min(dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + d[i-1]*d[k]*d[j]) \) for all \( i \leq k < j \)
- **Base Cases**: \( dp[i][i] = 0 \)
- **Approach**: Tabulation.

### 10. Subset Sum Problem
- **States**: \( dp[i][s] \) is true if a subset of the first \( i \) items has a sum of \( s \).
- **State Transition**: \( dp[i][s] = dp[i-1][s] \) or \( dp[i-1][s-items[i]] \)
- **Base Cases**: \( dp[0][0] = true, dp[i][0] = true, dp[0][s] = false \) for \( s > 0 \)
- **Approach**: Tabulation.

### 11. Maximum Sum Increasing Subsequence
- **States**: \( dp[i] \) represents the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence ending with the ith element.
- **State Transition**: \( dp[i] = \max(dp[i], dp[j] + arr[i]) \) for all \( j < i \) and \( arr[j] < arr[i] \)
- **Base Cases**: \( dp[i] = arr[i] \)
- **Approach**: Tabulation.

### 12. Word Break Problem
- **States**: \( dp[i] \) is true if the first \( i \) characters of the string can be segmented into words found in a dictionary.
- **State Transition**: \( dp[i] = \bigvee_{j=0}^{i-1} (dp[j] \land s[j+1:i] \in dictionary) \)
- **Base Cases**: \( dp[0] = true \) (empty string is a word)
- **Approach**: Tabulation.

Each of these problems illustrates how dynamic programming partitions the problem into discrete, manageable subproblems, solving each in turn to build up to a solution for the entire problem.
