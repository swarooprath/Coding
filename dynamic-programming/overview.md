Dynamic Programming (DP) is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is particularly useful for optimization problems. Here are the key aspects of Dynamic Programming:

1. **Overlapping Subproblems**: Dynamic Programming is applicable when the problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems, which means that the problem can be broken down into smaller problems which are reused several times.

2. **Optimal Substructure**: A problem exhibits optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the problem contains optimal solutions to its subproblems. This property is used in Dynamic Programming to construct a solution to the original problem from solutions to its subproblems.

3. **Memoization or Tabulation**: Dynamic Programming algorithms typically use one of these two techniques to store the results of intermediate subproblems:
   - **Memoization**: This is a top-down approach where you start solving the larger problem by recursively solving all subproblems first, as needed. The results of these subproblems are stored in a table (usually a hash table or an array), so they do not need to be recomputed every time.
   - **Tabulation**: This is a bottom-up approach where you solve all the subproblems first, often using iteration, and store their results in a table. The solution to the larger problem is then built iteratively from the values in the table.

4. **State Transition**: To solve a problem using Dynamic Programming, you define a state, which represents a subproblem, and then define how to transition from one state to another. Each state corresponds to a specific instance of the subproblem.

5. **Base Cases**: For recursion to terminate, you need to define base cases, which are the smallest subproblems which can be solved without further decomposition.

### Applications of Dynamic Programming
Dynamic Programming is widely used in various fields, including but not limited to:
- **Computer Science**: Algorithms for text comparison, graph theory (like shortest path algorithms), data compression, and more.
- **Operations Research**: Used in resource allocation, inventory management, and production planning.
- **Economics and Finance**: Dynamic stochastic optimization problems such as lifecycle consumption-saving models, portfolio choice problems, etc.
- **Bioinformatics**: Sequence alignment, protein folding, and other computational biology problems.

### Examples of Dynamic Programming Problems
Some classic examples of Dynamic Programming include:
- **Fibonacci Number Series**: Computing Fibonacci numbers using memoization to avoid the exponential time complexity of naive recursion.
- **Knapsack Problem**: Determining the most valuable subset of items that can be packed into a knapsack with weight constraints.
- **Coin Change Problem**: Finding the minimum number of coins needed to make a specific amount of money.
- **Longest Common Subsequence**: Finding the longest subsequence present in two sequences of items.

Dynamic Programming is a powerful technique that, once mastered, can be applied to a wide range of problems to find optimal solutions efficiently.
